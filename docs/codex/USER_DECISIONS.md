# KU-BO User Decision Queue

Codex must not execute a permanent deletion, scope expansion, gate weakening, licensing decision, credential use, paid service action, or merge without an explicit user decision.

## Open decisions

```text
DECISION_ID: KU-BO-008-D01
STATUS: OPEN
DATE_RAISED: 2026-08-10
TARGET: config/pilot/outcome_session_policy.json
CATEGORY: OTHER
CURRENT_STATE: The product catalog declares horizon_sessions but does not freeze how an outcome window advances through SUSPENDED or HALTED sessions.
WHY_A_DECISION_IS_REQUIRED: Different policies materially change outcome timing and measured returns. Civil-day arithmetic is forbidden, and Codex cannot select an investment-evaluation policy merely to make the data-foundation gate pass.
OPTIONS:
1. Advance through the official calendar to the next eligible official session, extending the horizon across suspended or halted sessions.
2. Keep the scheduled official-session horizon and record a non-fill/no-outcome state when the security cannot trade.
3. Freeze a product-specific policy with explicit maximum extension and terminal treatment.
CODEX_RECOMMENDATION: Option 3, using an explicit product-specific maximum extension and fail-closed terminal state; until then keep the shared policy UNFROZEN.
CONSEQUENCE_OF_APPROVAL: The selected policy can be encoded, tested across holidays/suspensions/actions, and the CLAIM_BOUNDARIES gate can be reevaluated.
IMPLEMENTATION_GUARD: Policy schema v1 intentionally rejects every FROZEN value. Merely committing global Option 1 does not approve this decision. Approval requires a later product-specific contract with maximum extension, terminal treatment, and a decision receipt bound to the approved choice.
CONSEQUENCE_OF_REJECTION: Final data-foundation reconciliation remains blocked from baseline-backtest readiness, while benchmark/EOD contracts remain usable for evidence collection.
SAFER_REVERSIBLE_ALTERNATIVE: Preserve the current UNFROZEN template and emit OUTCOME_SESSION_POLICY_NOT_FROZEN without producing outcome dates.

## Approved decisions

```text
DECISION_ID: KU-BO-MERGE-001
STATUS: APPROVED
DATE_RAISED: 2026-08-10
TARGET: Stacked PR chain #4 -> #5 -> #6 -> #7 -> #8 -> #9
CATEGORY: MERGE
CURRENT_STATE: All six PRs are open Drafts, exactly stacked on their predecessor heads, mergeable, and green on their recorded head CI. PR #9 closes KU-BO-008 as a fail-closed contract stage while real Benchmark/EOD evidence and KU-BO-008-D01 remain blocked.
WHY_A_DECISION_IS_REQUIRED: Repository rules prohibit any merge without explicit user approval and require stacked PRs to merge in dependency order.
OPTIONS:
1. Merge sequentially into main, retargeting each successor to main and requiring fresh green CI after every retarget.
2. Leave the complete stack open as Draft.
3. Retarget only PR #9 to main and collapse the whole stack into one oversized review.
CODEX_RECOMMENDATION: Option 1.
CONSEQUENCE_OF_APPROVAL: The reviewed engineering foundation enters main while all real-data, licensing, receipt, policy, backtest, forecast, and recommendation gates remain fail-closed.
CONSEQUENCE_OF_REJECTION: The validated implementation remains available only on the stacked branches.
SAFER_REVERSIBLE_ALTERNATIVE: Keep all PRs open and Draft without merging.
USER_DECISION: APPROVED in the active user session after review of the exact staged merge plan.
DECIDED_AT: 2026-08-10

## Rules

- Do not convert silence into approval.
- Do not delete a conversation merely because a summary was imported.
- Do not delete a repository file until references and tests have been checked.
- Prefer reversible archive or deprecation before deletion.
- Do not merge stacked PRs out of order.
- If a decision becomes unnecessary because the implementation changed, mark it `DEFERRED` or explain why it was withdrawn; do not erase the history.
