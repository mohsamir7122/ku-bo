## Completed and evidenced

- Read the 478-line master execution contract completely and bound this run to
  SHA-256 `2720a8778ade69a7d53a1ac5aa4a12c518ef4f845819601b662b0046773733d2`.
- Recorded operating system, disk, memory, network, tool versions, GitHub
  authentication, repository state, branches, remotes, open PRs, CI state,
  workflow state, and secret/variable presence without exposing credentials.
- Verified clean starting worktrees for both final repositories and all relevant
  local legacy/source checkouts.
- Created local rollback checkpoints for Kuwait and Saudi; no source checkout,
  branch, commit, PR, or user change was deleted or overwritten.
- Verified both contract-designated Drive project folders read-only. Each has
  the same 16 named subfolders. No Drive identifier is stored in this repository.
- Acquired the Termux wake lock. The current build remains in the existing tmux
  process; long-running periodic work is reserved for GitHub Actions.
- Established the Kuwait baseline in an isolated ignored virtual environment:
  2,243 tests ran in 601.170 seconds, with 2,242 passing and one pre-existing
  control-task/branch mismatch failing.
- Activated the strict day-one control surface on the actual work branch. The
  control validator, four focused control tests, JSON parsing, diff whitespace
  checks, private-Drive-link scan, and Secret Guard now pass.

## In progress

- Produce a runtime-source-bound capability and gap matrix for KU-BO, the
  `PRIVATE_PREDECESSOR_SOURCE`, the
  Saudi target, and the relevant archived/source repositories.
- Execute a deterministic synthetic dry run to verify plumbing only.

## Not started or not yet evidenced

- Real Kuwait company collection: 0 verified companies.
- Historical event library: 0 admitted unique events.
- Training, validation, locked blind test, and before/after investment metrics.
- Live research candidates. Current output is `ABSTAIN / NO-TRADE`.
- Saudi implementation. It remains sequenced after Kuwait gates pass.

## Active blockers and safeguards

- Required GitHub Secrets and repository variables are absent in both final
  repositories. Scheduled collection/live workflows must remain disabled or
  fail closed until exact contracts are supplied and validated.
- Latest `main` CI is red only because its completed task says `main` while the
  control unit test expects the prior integration branch. The day-one task uses
  a real work branch and keeps the assertion strict.
- PRoot exposes phone storage through existing binds. All writes in this run are
  restricted to the project workspace; no external storage is used.
- Synthetic fixtures are software evidence only. No return, accuracy,
  improvement, recommendation, or profit claim is authorized.

See `workouts/2026-08-27/` for the dated evidence and `NEXT_ACTIONS.md` for the
ordered continuation.
